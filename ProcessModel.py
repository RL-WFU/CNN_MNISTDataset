Observe: we use model_weights[j][k] s.t.:
    j is an integer between 0 and num_layers
    k is 0 (for weights) or 1 (for biases)
    
    Examples:
        model_weights[0][0] gives the weights of the first layer in the model
        model_weights[3][1] gives the biases of the fourth layer in the model
