"""
This file provides an example of how you would create, test, and save a new model.
All that has been changed in build_new_model() is added two convolutional layers for increased depth.
This increased depth makes times a lot longer... if you want to make sure your program is running,
a good idea is to change verbose from 0 to 1 in Testing.py line 143 (only to check that it is running, this gives a ton
of output).
